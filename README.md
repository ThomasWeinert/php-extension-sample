# PHP Extension Feature Samples

See main branch for general information about this repository.

## Basic Skeleton

This branch contains the basic files and code to get the extension to compile and be
available in PHP. It does not contain any functionality.

After compiling and configuring the extension run `php --re sample`. The output should 
comparable to:

```
Extension [ <persistent> extension #26 sample version 1.0 ] {
}
```

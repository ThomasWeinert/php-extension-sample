# PHP Extension Feature Samples

This repository is a collection of sample features for a php extension. 
Each [branch](https://github.com/ThomasWeinert/php-extension-sample/branches/all) implements 
a single feature. Basically I add my tests as branches as I am learning and experimenting.

The minimum version is PHP 8 (originally PHP 7). I am not going to implement BC for older versions.
